\description{
MS:4000097 \cr
"The number of times where MS1 TIC increased more than 10-fold between 
adjacent MS1 scans. An unusual high count of signal jumps or falls can 
indicate ESI stability issues." [PSI:MS] \cr

MS:4000098 \cr
"The number of times where MS1 TIC decreased more than 10-fold between 
adjacent MS1 scans. An unusual high count of signal jumps or falls can 
indicate ESI stability issues." [PSI:MS] \cr

The metric is calculated as follows: \cr
(1) the \code{Spectra} object is filtered according to the MS level, \cr 
(2) the intensity of the precursor ions within \code{spectra} are obtained, \cr 
(3) the intensity values of the features are obtained via the ion count, \cr 
(4) the signal jumps/declines of the intensity values with the two 
subsequent intensity values is calculated, \cr 
(5) in the case of *MS:4000097*, the signal jumps by a factor of ten or more
are counted and returned; \cr
in the case of *MS:4000098*, the signal declines by a factor of ten or more
are counted and returned. \cr

The function \code{msSignal10xChange} uses the function \code{ionCount} as an 
equivalent to the TIC.

An attribute will only be returned if \code{msLevel} is 1.
